# Configuring an application

As we learned in the previous guide, an application must be configured in the
`Init` function by returning options, of type
[`*blacksmith.Options`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith?tab=doc#Options).

Please refer to [the configuration reference](/blacksmith/options) for properly
configure your application, depending on your needs. This should only takes a
few minutes.
