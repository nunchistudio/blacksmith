# Configuring a project

As we learned in the previous guide, an application must be configured in the
`Init` function by returning options, of type
[`*blacksmith.Options`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith?tab=doc#Options).

Please refer to [the configuration reference](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/options)
for properly configure your application, depending on your needs. This should only
takes a few minutes.
