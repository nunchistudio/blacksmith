# Exploring the dashboard

The Blacksmith Dashboard enables organizations to have a complete view of their
data engineering solution. It is built on top of the Blacksmith UI kit, which
leverages the REST API only available in the Enterprise Edition.

To make forks and customization as easy as possible, the dashboard is available as
an [open-source "template" repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith-dashboard).

You can access the dashboard by opening your bowser at <http://localhost:9091/admin/>.

When searching for events, you should see the first one we've just made:

You should also see the job created that ran in the data warehouse:
