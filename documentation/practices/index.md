# Best practices

The following guides are meant to provide *guidance* for an ideal deployment of
Blacksmith, not to document requirements. It is entirely possible to use Blacksmith
without applying any of the following recommendations.

These are best practice recommendations that should be applied when possible and
practical.
- The "**Data management**" section gives recommendations for working with data at
  scale for an optimal experience across teams.
- The "**Production hardening**" section gives recommendations for deploying and
  securing Blacksmith applications in the cloud.
