# Blacksmith

Blacksmith is a low-code platform offering a complete and consistent approach for
self-hosted data engineering solutions. Blacksmith allows **software engineers**
to write low-code ETL using the Go language. It also allows **data engineers**
to write templated SQL for TLT and database migrations on top of one or multiple
databases.

Any team that is building — or think about building — such a platform knows the
tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think of
Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you to
save months of customized and professional work.

## Product offerings

**Blacksmith is not an open-source software.** This repository only holds the
public Go APIs, allowing organizations to build reliable data engineering solutions
on top of Blacksmith using Go and SQL. Blacksmith itself is built and distributed
as a CLI and as [a Docker image](https://github.com/nunchistudio/blacksmith-docker).

[Blacksmith is available in two Editions](https://nunchi.studio/blacksmith/pricing):
- **Blacksmith Standard Edition** addresses the technical complexity of data
  engineering. It is and will always be free. This Edition focuses on building
  ETLT platforms with Go and SQL for better data quality and stronger data
  reliability across systems.
- **Blacksmith Enterprise Edition** addresses the complexity of collaboration and
  governance across multi-team and multi-scope data solutions. This Edition adds
  advanced features for the enterprises, such as migrations management, distributed
  semaphore, and a built-in dashboard.
