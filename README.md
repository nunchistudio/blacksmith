# Blacksmith

After a few years we decided to crystallize all of our data engineering best
practices into a product, on top of which organizations can layer cloud-assisted
data solutions.

Blacksmith is a Software Development Kit specifically designed for data engineering
teams. It allows you to build reliable data pipelines in a consistent way. Whether
you are collecting data from HTTP APIs, CRON tasks, or CDC notifications and whether
you are loading this data in realtime to third-party services or using a specific
schedule to data warehouses.

Any team that is building — or think about building — a complete data pipeline knows
the tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think
of Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you
to save months of customized and professional ETL work.

## Product offerings

Blacksmith is available in two editions:

- **Blacksmith Standard Edition** addresses the technical complexity of data engineering.
  It is and will always be free.
- **Blacksmith Enterprise Edition** addresses the complexity of collaboration and
  governance across multi-team and multi-scope data solutions.
