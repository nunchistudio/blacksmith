# Blacksmith

After a few years we decided to crystallize all of our data engineering best
practices into a product, on top of which organizations can layer cloud-assisted
data solutions.

Blacksmith is a platform specifically designed for data engineering teams. It allows
you to build reliable data pipelines in a consistent way. Data extraction can happen
on HTTP requests, CRON schedules, CDC notifications, and Pub / Sub messages. Then,
jobs can be created against any kind of destination, such as HTTP APIs or data
warehouses.

The goal of Blacksmith is to address as many pain points as possible engineering
teams encounter while working on data solutions.

Any team that is building — or think about building — a complete data pipeline knows
the tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think
of Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you
to save months of customized and professional ETL work.
