/*
Package blacksmith is the package to create applications on top of Blacksmith.

Blacksmith is a low-code platform offering a complete and consistent approach for
self-managed data engineering. Blacksmith allows software engineers to write
low-code ETL using the Go language. It also allows data engineers to write
templated SQL for TLT and database migrations on top of one or multiple databases.

Any team that is building — or think about building — a data engineering platform
knows the tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission.
Think of Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading
you to save months of customized and professional work.

A new application can be generated using the Blacksmith CLI:

  $ blacksmith generate application --name <name> [--path <path>]
