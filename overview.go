/*
Package blacksmith is the package to create applications on top of the Blacksmith
framework.

Blacksmith is a cloud-native framework specifically designed for data engineering
teams. It allows you to design, build, and deploy reliable data platforms in a
consistent way. The goal of Blacksmith is to address as many pain points as possible
engineering teams encounter while working on data solutions.

Any team that is building — or think about building — a complete data platform knows
the tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this mission. Think
of Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow, leading you
to save months of customized and professional work.

A new application can be generated using the Blacksmith CLI:

  $ blacksmith generate application --name <name> [--path <path>]
