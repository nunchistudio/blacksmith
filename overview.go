/*
Package blacksmith is the core package to create applications on top of Blacksmith.

Blacksmith is a Software Development Kit specifically designed for data engineering
teams. It allows you to build reliable data pipelines in a consistent way. Whether
you are collecting data from HTTP APIs, CRON tasks or ongoing event listeners and
whether you are loading this data in realtime to third-party services or using a
specific schedule to data warehouses.

This package ensures the harmony between the SDK, the CLI and the adapters used
by the application on top of it.

A new Blacksmith application can be generated using the Blacksmith CLI:

  $ blacksmith init

Note: Application generation using the Blacksmith CLI is a feature only available
in Blacksmith Enterprise.
