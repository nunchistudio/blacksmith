Package blacksmith is the package to create applications on top of Blacksmith.

Blacksmith is a programmable low-code ecosystem, offering a complete and consistent
data engineering solution. It allows you to design, build, and deploy reliable data
engineering platforms in a consistent way. The goal of Blacksmith is to address as
many pain points as possible data engineering teams encounter.

Any team that is building — or think about building — a complete data engineering
platform knows the tremendous amount of work needed to properly accomplish this
mission. Think of Blacksmith as the central piece of your data engineering workflow,
leading you to save months of customized and professional work.

A new application can be generated using the Blacksmith CLI:

  $ blacksmith generate application --name <name> [--path <path>]
